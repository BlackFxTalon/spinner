spinner is a simple spinner component where I tried the asynchronous requestAnimationFrame() function and canceling the animation cancelAnimationFrame(). Accordingly, the draw ()function itself is responsible for animating the spinner. There are also two buttons - start (start the draw() function by the click event handler) and stop (the cancelAnimationFrame() function is triggered on click).
